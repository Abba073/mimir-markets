/**
 * Wallet-option shaping for the connect modal — ordering, labels and badges.
 *
 * Pure and separate from the React tree so the rules that decide what a user sees
 * first can be tested without a browser or an installed extension.
 *
 * ── What changed versus the EVM version this replaces ────────────────────────
 *
 * The EVM list was an accident of discovery: a generic injected connector, a
 * vendor-specific one and an EIP-6963 announcement could all describe the same
 * extension, so most of the old logic was dedupe and substring guessing at ids
 * that drifted between library versions.
 *
 * Stellar Wallet Kit hands back a fixed, curated roster instead
 * (`refreshSupportedWallets()`), one entry per product, with a stable `productId`
 * and an authoritative `isAvailable` — so there is nothing to dedupe and no
 * guessing. What remains is genuinely a presentation decision:
 *
 *  - a wallet that is not installed still has to be listed, with somewhere to go
 *    (`url`), or someone holding only Lobstr has no way in;
 *  - being inside a wallet's own in-app browser is the strongest possible signal
 *    and outranks everything, including the wallet used last;
 *  - hardware wallets sort last: they are a deliberate choice, never a default.
