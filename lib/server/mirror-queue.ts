/**
 * What a basket subscriber has not mirrored yet.
 *
 * Following a basket records an intent; it cannot move money on its own. Soroban
 * has no `msg.sender` for a top-level call, so the staking account is an explicit
 * argument that must itself authorise — `challenge_claim(challenger, …)` cannot
 * execute without that account's signature, and Mimir holds no key for the
 * subscriber. Delegated signing would need an owner-granted USDC allowance
 * (`lib/agents/spend-permissions.ts`), which a plain basket follower has not given.
 *
 * So the honest middle is this: compute what the subscriber WOULD have mirrored,
 * show it, and let them sign it themselves in one click. No custody, no waiting on
 * infrastructure that is not configured, and the queue is exactly the input the
 * delegated executor will consume once it exists.
 *
 * Positions already taken are excluded, so a mirror is never offered twice and
 * re-following does not duplicate anything.
