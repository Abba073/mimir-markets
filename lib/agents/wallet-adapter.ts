/**
 * Vendor-neutral wallet boundary for BYOA funded actions, Stellar edition.
 *
 * ── Why the EVM shape could not be ported field-for-field ────────────────────
 *
 * The old adapter described a call as `{ target, data, value }` — an address, ABI
 * calldata, and native ETH. None of the three survives the move:
 *
 *   `data`   Soroban has no calldata. An invocation is a contract id, a function
 *            name and typed arguments, and the generated bindings build the
 *            envelope. There is no opaque byte string to hand around, so
 *            {@link AgentWalletCall} carries the assembled-call factory instead.
 *   `value`  There is no payable call. XLM is the fee, never an argument, so the
 *            old `native_value_forbidden` rejection has nothing left to reject —
 *            it is gone rather than kept as a check that can never fire.
 *   gas      Sponsorship is gone as a product decision (agents self-fund their
 *            own sub-cent fees), so `sponsorGas` and
 *            `gas_sponsorship_not_allowed` are gone with it.
 *
 * What DOES survive unchanged is the part that matters: the budget policy. Those
 * ceilings are pure arithmetic over atomic USDC and are identical on any chain,
 * so {@link authorizeWalletCall} keeps its exact semantics minus the two
 * rejections that referred to EVM-only concepts.
